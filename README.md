# Shinobi Blog

This is a simple blog application called **Shinobi**, built as a starter project for a Claude Code crash course. The application demonstrates modern web development practices using Next.js and serves as a foundation for learning AI-assisted development with Claude Code.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Claude Code

This project serves as a practical example for learning Claude Code capabilities:

### Core Features

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Use Claude Code to make intelligent edits, refactor code, and add new features
- **CLAUDE.md Files**: Learn to create and maintain CLAUDE.md files for project context and memory
- **GitHub Integration**: Practice using Claude Code with GitHub workflows, PR reviews, and issue management
- **Slash Commands**: Explore built-in slash commands for quick actions and navigation
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Create and configure custom slash commands for project-specific workflows
  - `/merged`: Clean up after PR merge by switching to main, pulling changes, and deleting the merged branch
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Integrate with MCP servers for extended functionality

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how to work collaboratively with AI on real projects
- Master Claude Code's file editing and code generation capabilities
- Learn best practices for maintaining AI context in larger codebases
- Explore automation possibilities with GitHub Actions and Claude Code
- Practice iterative development with AI assistance

## Test Message Inbox

Quick URL for mobile-to-desktop message testing:

```
localhost:3001/test-messages
```

## Running the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Final Thoughts

### Check the Code Yourself

- AI Can make mistakes.
- Checking the code keeps you in the loop.

### Context is Key

- Be smart about what context you provide.
- Keep it relevant & the history lean where possible.
- Use /clear and /compact commands.

### Don't rely on AI to do EVERYTHING

- It will make you lazy!
- You'll find it harder to learn new skills.

### AI in Coding will Bring More Opportunity

- More areas to specialize - MCP, Agentic tools, Custom integrations, etc
- There will still be a demand for good programmers.
- Learning to code is more important than ever!
